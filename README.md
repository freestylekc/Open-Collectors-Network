#Open Collectors Network The future protocol for one-of-a-kind tokens.

This repository contains all smart contracts code from the Open Collectors Network projec, and is split into 3 parts:

  + Ecto token - standard ERC20 token, based on open zeppelin
  + Ecto platform - ERC721 token implementation, with extra features added
  + an older impl for the ERC20 token, now obsolete.
